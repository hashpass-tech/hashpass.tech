# hashpass-video-studio

Remotion-based studio for cutting HASHPASS marketing/demo videos — the app
tutorial (landing → sign-up → dashboard → profile → events → PWA install, in
**English and Spanish**), the BSL On Tour showcase, and future promo cuts —
as versioned React code instead of a `.aep`/`.prproj` binary nobody else on
the team can open or diff.

## Why Remotion (and not something else)

Evaluated against the realistic alternatives before scaffolding this app:

| Tool | Verdict |
|---|---|
| **Remotion** (chosen) | Programmatic video-as-React, ships a real editor (Remotion Studio) with a scrubbable timeline/player, renders via headless Chrome + bundled ffmpeg, has a mature CLI/render farm story, and — the deciding factor for this repo — compositions can directly reuse `@hashpass/ui`, `@hashpass/i18n`, and the brand SVGs already in the monorepo. No other tool below can do that. |
| Motion Canvas / Revideo | Code-based like Remotion, but centered on a custom canvas/vector-scene API, not React — can't reuse existing app components, smaller ecosystem, weaker CLI/render tooling. |
| Shotstack / Creatomate (cloud template APIs) | Fast for swapping text into a fixed template, but it's JSON-template-driven, not code — no component reuse, adds a paid external dependency and vendor lock-in for something we can self-host. |
| After Effects / Premiere | Most powerful *manual* editor, but binary project files don't diff or review in git, and there's no way to script "record the real app and cut it automatically." Fine for a human polish pass on the final export if ever needed, not for the pipeline itself. |
| Editly / FFCreator | Lightweight ffmpeg/canvas video assemblers — good for one-off config-driven cuts, but no live preview editor and no component model. Strictly less capable than Remotion for this use case. |

Conclusion: Remotion stays the most powerful option on the market for this
specific job (component reuse + real preview/editing studio + scriptable
render pipeline), so this app is a straight Remotion Studio setup, not a
custom build.

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm dev:video-studio          # just the studio
# or
pnpm dev:all                   # studio + mobile app + club web + docs + directus
```

`dev:all` claims a port starting at `VIDEO_STUDIO_PORT` (default `3105`,
auto-bumps if busy — check the "Using ports:" line it prints) and opens
Remotion Studio there alongside the other dev servers, so you can record a
flow from the running mobile-app/web-app dev server and drop the capture
straight into the studio without leaving the `dev:all` session.

## Diffusion Studio handoff

Remotion remains the canonical composition and final-render engine. Use
[Diffusion Studio](https://diffusion.studio/download) for agent-assisted
footage analysis, rough cuts, captions, and generated source media, then
bring an explicitly approved cut into this studio rather than maintaining a
second timeline here.

In the Diffusion project directory, create `hashpass-handoff.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": "diffusion-studio",
  "imports": [{
    "id": "event-discovery-v1",
    "composition": "AppTutorialEN",
    "source": "exports/event-discovery.mp4",
    "title": "Discover events",
    "caption": "Find your next event",
    "trimStartSeconds": 0
  }]
}
```

Then import it:

```bash
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio diffusion:import -- \
  --project /absolute/path/to/diffusion-project
```

The importer accepts only media inside that project (`.mp4`, `.mov`, or
`.webm`), copies it under `public/recordings/diffusion/`, and updates
`src/content/diffusion-imports.json`. Those entries are appended to the
declared target composition and are rendered by Remotion like every other
recording. The generated manifest is reviewable source of truth; do not
commit Diffusion's editor cache or agent credentials.

### Claude creative briefs

Claude creates the prompt and review checklist; it is **not** the video
generator. Create a local event-input file containing only verified public
event facts:

```json
{
  "id": "cbweek2026",
  "title": "Colombia Blockchain Week 2026",
  "city": "Medellín",
  "country": "Colombia",
  "startDate": "2026-12-11",
  "endDate": "2026-12-12",
  "themes": ["blockchain", "community", "technology"]
}
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` in your ignored local
environment (the placeholders live in the repository root `.env.example`),
then generate a reviewable brief:

```bash
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio diffusion:brief -- \
  --event /absolute/path/to/cbweek2026.json \
  --output /absolute/path/to/diffusion-project/cbweek2026-brief.json
```

Review that brief in Diffusion Studio, generate or select the actual loop,
export the approved media into the Diffusion project, and use the handoff
import command above. Never put the API key in an `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variable,
the mobile app, or a client-side event-explorer request. Automated production
brief batches will use Anthropic Workload Identity Federation rather than an
API key.

## Public event hero loops

`src/content/event-hero-specs.json` is the reviewed inventory for every
public discovery event. Each loop is a silent, eight-second HASHPASS-branded
Remotion composition with the approved event lockup and an abstract city
backdrop derived from its verified city and venue metadata. The render also
emits an event-scoped JPEG poster from the same composition. It deliberately
does not fabricate people, speakers, dates, or venue footage; live banner
copy and that poster remain the accessible UI and failure fallback.

```bash
# Prepares the approved logo inputs and renders all hero MP4s locally.
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio event-heroes:render

# Lists the immutable CDN destinations without changing AWS.
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio event-heroes:publish

# Publishes only after the rendered loops and dry-run URLs are reviewed.
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio run event-heroes:publish -- --publish

# Publish only the static fallbacks when the immutable MP4s already exist.
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio run event-heroes:publish -- --posters-only --publish
```

Set `EVENT_MEDIA_BUCKET`, `EVENT_MEDIA_REGION`, and
`EVENT_MEDIA_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` only in ignored local environment files. The
publisher only accepts the approved event-media bucket, verifies the `hashpass`
AWS profile against `AWS_TARGET_ACCOUNT_ID`, writes immutable event-scoped
keys, and requires the explicit `--publish` flag. It atomically refuses to
replace an existing object, so revised media must use a newly reviewed asset
version. Do not release
the application configuration until that publish succeeds; otherwise its
image fallback is preferable to a broken video URL.

## Layout

```
src/
  index.ts                 # registerRoot entry point
  Root.tsx                  # registers BslShowcase, AppTutorialEN, AppTutorialES via calculateMetadata
  constants.ts               # fps/resolution/intro-outro/placeholder-clip timing
  content/clips.ts            # the clip manifests (EN + ES) — see "Adding a real recording"
  lib/clip-layout.ts           # auto-sizes each clip's Sequence to its real recording length
  components/
    BrandBumper.tsx            # intro/outro title card (HASHPASS logo + copy, translatable props)
    RecordingSlot.tsx           # renders a clip if present, else a placeholder card
    PlayStoreBadge.tsx           # "GET IT ON Google Play" badge overlay for the install-CTA clip
  compositions/
    AppTutorial.tsx               # shared component for both AppTutorialEN/ES (Root.tsx passes the language's steps + bumper copy)
    BslShowcase.tsx                # BSL On Tour showcase reel
flows/                               # Playwright step scripts, one per recording (see below)
  lib/dismiss-cookie-banner.mjs       # shared helper: dismiss the cookie-consent banner before scrolling/clicking
public/
  brand/                                # HASHPASS logo SVGs (copied from apps/web-app/public)
  recordings/                            # raw screen captures land here, one folder per flow (gitignored)
    landing/  auth/otp/  auth/google/  dashboard/  dashboard/speakers/  pwa/  bsl/
scripts/render.mjs                        # renders every composition to out/*.mp4
```

Every composition boots and previews correctly with **zero recordings** —
`RecordingSlot` shows a "recording pending" placeholder card for any clip
whose `src` isn't set yet, so the studio is usable from the first `pnpm
install` and fills in incrementally as real footage lands.

### Status

- **BslShowcase**: event landing + agenda-browse are real recordings; the
  meeting-request clip is still a placeholder (needs a real authenticated
  session — see the auth section below).
- **AppTutorialEN / AppTutorialES**: all 6 steps are real recordings —
  landing, OTP/magic-link sign-up, dashboard entry, attendee-profile update,
  browse events & speakers (with an actual event switch demonstrated), and
  installing the app as a PWA.

### Real captures need a real session — how this got unblocked

Two of the app's core flows can't be completed unattended by an agent:

- **OTP sign-in** needs a real inbox to read the 6-digit code.
- **Google sign-in** is actively blocked for automated browsers by Google's
  own bot detection, headed or not.

For the dashboard/profile/events recordings, `packages/tools/scripts/create-demo-session.mjs`
mints a **real** Supabase session for a dedicated demo account
(`video-studio-demo@hashpass.tech`) without going through either of those —
it mirrors exactly what the app's own server-side OTP flow does
(`admin.generateLink()` + a direct GoTrue `/verify` call), the same two-step
dance a human completes by reading a real email, just without the email
round-trip. It also upserts the `public.user` registry row the demo
account's `auth.users` id needs — most downstream tables (`user_profiles`,
etc.) FK against `public.user.id`, and that registry sync normally only
happens inside the app's own auth API routes, which this path skips:

```bash
node packages/tools/scripts/create-demo-session.mjs
# writes apps/video-studio/.recording-state/demo-session.json
```

The result is a Playwright `storageState` JSON — pass it straight to
`--use-state` on any recording. It contains live session tokens; it's
gitignored (`apps/video-studio/.recording-state/`) and must never be
committed.

For screens that just need *any* logged-in state and don't touch real
account data, `apps/mobile-app/lib/auth/dev-bypass.ts` is a lighter dev-only
alternative (`EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=true`, `__DEV__`-gated) — but the
attendee-profile screen specifically renders a permanent loading skeleton
under it (`user` stays `null`), so that one needs the real demo session.

### Recording in Spanish

`record-web-demo.mjs --locale es-ES` is all it takes — the app's i18n
(`apps/mobile-app/i18n/i18n.ts`) picks its initial language from the
browser's own locale (`expo-localization`) on first load, with no stored
override and no in-app language-switch click needed. `content/clips.ts`
exports `appTutorialStepsEn` and `appTutorialStepsEs` (own translated
titles/captions), and `Root.tsx` registers them as separate compositions,
`AppTutorialEN` / `AppTutorialES`, each with its own translated intro/outro
bumper copy passed as props to the shared `AppTutorial` component.

One real, honest gap: the attendee-profile screen
(`app/(shared)/dashboard/profile.tsx`) hardcodes its English strings rather
than using the app's `t()` helper, so that one clip's on-screen chrome
("Attendee Information", "Edit Attendee Information", etc.) stays English
even in the ES composition — a real characteristic of the current app, not
a recording bug.

### Clips auto-size to the real recording length

Real captures vary a lot — a landing-page scroll is ~10s, an OTP or Google
sign-in recording with a manual-entry pause can run 30s+. `Root.tsx` uses
Remotion's `calculateMetadata` to call `layoutClips()`
(`src/lib/clip-layout.ts`), which reads each recorded file's real duration
via `getVideoMetadata` and sizes that clip's `Sequence` to match — no manual
frame-count math when you drop in a new recording. Clips still missing a
`src` fall back to a fixed placeholder length (`CLIP_FRAMES` in
`constants.ts`).

Every real capture also has a few seconds of blank page-load baked into its
start (Playwright's video starts recording at browser-context creation,
before the navigation even begins — a warmup pre-navigation doesn't fix it,
since the delay is client-side data fetching, not asset loading). Rather
than re-recording, set `trimStartSeconds` on the `ClipSlot` to skip that
dead air — check a new capture's early frames first:

```bash
ffmpeg -i public/recordings/<file>.webm -ss 00:00:0N -frames:v 1 -update 1 out.png
# try a few values of N; once file size jumps from ~8.6KB (blank) to real
# content, that's roughly your trim point
```

Metro serves from its warm bundle cache on repeat recordings against an
already-running dev server, so later captures of the *same route* in a
session often paint much faster than the first — don't assume every clip
needs the same trim.

## Adding a real recording

1. Capture footage (see below) — it lands in the matching
   `public/recordings/<flow>/` folder.
2. Set `src: '<flow>/<file>.webm'` on the matching entry in
   `src/content/clips.ts` (`appTutorialStepsEn`/`Es` or `bslShowcaseClips`).

That's it — no other code changes. `RecordingSlot` picks it up and the
composition automatically re-times itself to the clip's real length.

## Capturing footage

**Web / Expo-web flows** — the landing page, sign-in, and dashboard all run
on the Expo web target during `dev:all` (`http://localhost:8081` by default,
check the printed port). Use the Playwright recorder in
`packages/tools/scripts/record-web-demo.mjs`, exposed as `record:web`.
`--name` may include the flow's subfolder, e.g. `landing/hero`.

| Step | Flow script | Auth needed |
|---|---|---|
| Landing page | `flows/landing.mjs` | None |
| Sign up — OTP or magic link | *(none — plain `--duration`)* | None (form only, code not entered) |
| Enter the dashboard | `flows/dashboard-explore.mjs` | Real session or dev bypass |
| Update attendee profile | `flows/dashboard-profile.mjs` | **Real session required** |
| Browse events & speakers | `flows/dashboard-events-speakers.mjs` | Real session or dev bypass |
| Install as an app (PWA) | `flows/pwa-install.mjs` | None |
| Google sign-in (not in the core 6 steps yet) | `flows/auth-google.mjs` | — (this *is* the sign-in) |
| BSL event landing + agenda | `flows/bsl-showcase.mjs` (+ plain `--duration`) | None |
| BSL meeting request & schedule | `flows/dashboard-find-speakers.mjs`, `flows/dashboard-request-meeting.mjs` | **Real session required** |

```bash
# 1. Mint a real demo session once (see "Real captures need a real session" above):
node packages/tools/scripts/create-demo-session.mjs

# 2. Landing / sign-up form / PWA install — no auth needed:
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio record:web -- \
  --url http://localhost:8081/home --name landing/hero \
  --flow apps/video-studio/flows/landing.mjs

pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio record:web -- \
  --url http://localhost:8081/home --name pwa/install \
  --flow apps/video-studio/flows/pwa-install.mjs

# 3. Dashboard / profile / events — reuse the demo session:
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio record:web -- \
  --url http://localhost:8081/dashboard/profile --name dashboard/profile-update \
  --flow apps/video-studio/flows/dashboard-profile.mjs \
  --use-state apps/video-studio/.recording-state/demo-session.json

# 4. Same again with --locale es-ES for the Spanish take, e.g.:
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio record:web -- \
  --url http://localhost:8081/dashboard/explore --name dashboard/explore-es \
  --flow apps/video-studio/flows/dashboard-explore.mjs \
  --use-state apps/video-studio/.recording-state/demo-session.json \
  --locale es-ES
```

- Omit `--flow` for a quick single-screen capture — it just loads `--url`
  and auto-scrolls for `--duration` ms (default 8000).
- `--headed` runs a visible browser instead of headless — required for
  anything with a manual step (typing a real OTP code, completing Google's
  consent screen). `--channel chrome` uses a real installed Chrome instead
  of Playwright's bundled Chromium, which helps (but doesn't guarantee)
  getting past Google's automated-browser detection.
- `--save-state <path>` / `--use-state <path>` persist and reuse a login
  session (cookies + localStorage) across separate recordings. State files
  are gitignored — they contain live session tokens, never commit them.
- `--locale es-ES` records the app in Spanish — see "Recording in Spanish"
  above.
- `flows/lib/dismiss-cookie-banner.mjs` is a shared helper — import it in
  any new flow that scrolls into or clicks something near the bottom of the
  viewport, since the cookie-consent banner sits fixed there on first visit
  and both obscures content and intercepts clicks until dismissed.
- Every flow script has real selectors pulled from the actual app copy
  ("Send Code", "Sign in with Google", "Find Speakers", "Install HASHPASS",
  etc. — see `flows/*.mjs`), not placeholders. If the app's copy changes,
  update the matching regex there.
- Output is `.webm` (Playwright's native format) — Remotion's `OffthreadVideo`
  decodes it directly via its bundled ffmpeg, no conversion step needed.

**Native Android** (the real BSL/app flows on-device, for footage the web
target can't produce): use
[local-android-debugging.md](../docs/docs/reference/mobile-app/local-android-debugging.md)
to get an emulator/device connected via `adb`, then capture with either:

```bash
# Straight to a video file via adb (device-side, then pull it):
adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/demo.mp4
# ...Ctrl+C when done, then:
adb pull /sdcard/demo.mp4 apps/video-studio/public/recordings/bsl/demo.mp4

# Or scrcpy, if installed, which can record while mirroring the screen live:
scrcpy --record apps/video-studio/public/recordings/bsl/demo.mp4
```

Then wire the file up the same way as a web recording (set `src` in
`src/content/clips.ts`).

## Rendering

```bash
pnpm video-studio:render                 # renders every composition to out/*.mp4
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio render AppTutorialEN   # just one
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio render AppTutorialES
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio render AppTutorialNarratedEN
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio render AppTutorialNarratedES
pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio render BslShowcase
```

`out/`, `public/recordings/*` (contents, not the folders), and
`.recording-state/` are gitignored — they're large/sensitive artifacts
regenerated from the compositions/flows, not source.

## Narrated variant (voice + music + transition SFX)

`AppTutorialNarratedEN` / `AppTutorialNarratedES` are a second cut of the
same recordings/layout as `AppTutorialEN`/`ES`, adding:

- **Per-screen voiceover** — `src/content/narration.json` (source of truth,
  read by both the TS composition and the plain-JS generation script) holds
  one line per step, synthesized via **edge-tts**, Microsoft Edge's free
  neural TTS (the same service behind Edge's "Read aloud" — no API key, just
  `pip install edge-tts`):
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio narration:generate
  # -> public/audio/narration/{en,es}/<slug>.mp3
  ```
  Voices: `en-US-AriaNeural` / `es-ES-ElviraNeural`. Each line was sized to
  comfortably fit inside its clip's real trimmed duration — check with
  `ffprobe` if you edit `narration.json` or re-time a clip.
- **Background music + transition whoosh** — there's no music-generation
  tool available in this environment, and sourcing a real track would mean
  clearing an actual license, so `scripts/generate-audio-bed.mjs`
  synthesizes both purely with ffmpeg's audio filters (sine-wave chord pad +
  filtered pink noise) — an original, license-free first pass, not a
  polished library track:
  ```bash
  pnpm --filter hashpass-video-studio audio:generate
  # -> public/audio/music/elegant-bed.mp3 (~100s, loops the whole composition)
  # -> public/audio/sfx/transition.mp3    (short whoosh at every clip boundary)
  ```
  Swap either file for a licensed asset later if a richer result is needed —
  nothing else changes, `AppTutorialNarrated.tsx` just reads those two paths.

`AppTutorialNarrated.tsx` is a separate component from `AppTutorial.tsx`
(not an optional-audio flag on it) — the plain silent cut stays simple, this
one is clearly the "with voice + music" variant. Music sits at low volume
(`MUSIC_VOLUME` in that file) so narration stays clear; narration starts a
few frames into each clip so it doesn't land exactly on the cut.
